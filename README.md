**I: Project Background**  
*Taken from https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project-teams/pilot-planktoscope-climate-change-research-2022-2023*  

Microbes are core components of the ecology and functioning of all ecosystems, including plants, animals and engineered systems. While there is a burgeoning understanding of the abundance and diversity of microbial communities, comparatively little work has focused on the impact of “grazers” (small plankton that eat microbes) on their mortality.

The importance of grazers is broadly recognized, but there remain significant technological challenges to characterizing and quantifying these organisms. Developing a better understanding of these plankton has important implications for the sustainable production of food, feed and fuel.

**II: Project Description**  
This project team will fabricate and test a beta version of a “planktoscope” that has the ability to automatically take pictures of and identify larger plankton (including zooplankton/predators) from marine samples. 

In the first phase of the project, the team will work in the Co-Lab on campus in Durham to build the device using open source instructions. This initial part of the project will include reviewing the long-term goals of the project (characterizing grazers in natural and engineered communities), assessing current hardware and software design suggestions in the context of goals and hardware availability, and making recommendations for any initial modifications. After developing an engineering plan, the team will build the first version of the planktoscope. 

In the second phase of the project, the beta design will be evaluated at the Duke Marine Lab in Beaufort for two applications relevant to energy and environment: a coastal marine time series with weekly microbiome sampling; and marine microalgae ponds for sustainable production of food, feed and fuel.
